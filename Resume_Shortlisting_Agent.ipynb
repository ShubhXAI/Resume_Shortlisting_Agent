        "        - **Project Impact:** Has worked on end-to-end projects and can articulate the business value or impact of their work, preferably with quantifiable metrics (e.g., improved model accuracy by X%, reduced operational costs, etc.).\n",
        "        - **Modern Skills (Highly Desirable):** Experience with more advanced topics such as Deep Learning (TensorFlow/PyTorch), MLOps, cloud data platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure), or Generative AI (LLMs, RAG, LangChain) is a significant plus.\n",

        "            - Hands-on experience with core machine learning models (classification, regression, etc.).\n",

        "            - **The Senior Specialist:** Has significant senior-level experience (e.g., 8+ years) in a related field like Software Engineering, Data Engineering, or traditional Business Intelligence, but lacks direct, modern ML project experience. They show strong foundational skills that could be transferable.\n",
